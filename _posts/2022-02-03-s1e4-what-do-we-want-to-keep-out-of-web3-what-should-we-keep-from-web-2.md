- Key Takeaways
    - Keep predatory behavior out of web3.
- Topic: What do we want to keep out of web3? What do we want to keep from web2?
    - Rules
    - Predatory behavior & Code illiteracy
    - James: break the question up. Let’s start: what we want to keep from web2. Keep out predatory deals. I think, chasing algorithms is something we shouldn’t do. It’s annoying. Even in that, we also need a better solution of discovery. We need to build that system together.
    - Pat: the whole Twitterverse of music. I say whole - I have never seen anything like that since been on Twitter, where every musician that I know and follow spoke up with the Hit Piece thing. That’s predatory behavior. On this point, that’s something I don’t want to see in web3 is that kind of behavior, it’s very web2 predatory behavior. But to see like, a bunch of musicians come together for one purpose, was so exciting. Brought up the pay to play thing, and I don’t want to see that in web3. Translated over, that’s people performing in the metaverse which I hope that doesn’t happen. The biggest thing in my heart, dealing with past traumas that I’ve been through, not specifically in music but just like in life, just gate-keeper mentality. There’s a difference between protecting and gatekeeping. I am believer that no matter what happens in life, as long as you stay humble and keep working, you will get yours. But that doesn’t mean gatekeeping is not annoying. I’ve seen it already in web3 and it sucks, it’s trash. What’s crazy — I don’t want to get deep on psychology, but it’s crazy how some of the traumas we deal with — if we don’t work through that and do appropriate healing, we end up becoming the thing that we hate. I don’t want to see that here.
    - ideserveartdotcom: I don’t think it’s controversial, but it sounds a bit rude. This question is low-key irrelevant. There are people that will be predatory, and there are others.
        - James: just to clarify - on the, title, but this is the goal: to point out, what we don’t like, but to move towards solutions. So, what do we want to keep from web2?
        - Art: I just want to keep out — I want us to stop spending energy on things that don’t matter. Focusing on ourselves, focusing on getting to know who we are, and focusing on hope and man, and being one with the creator in nature, and knowing how to breathe properly, and knowing your body, and communicate telepathically, and in tune with your intuition. When you do, it’s less important of what other people do, and you can just bypass that.
        - Pat: those things take practice, and everyone isn’t at that point yet, but it’s easier said than done. There’s a process that goes behind that, and it takes self but a tribe of people to do that. But I definitely here what you’re saying. I want to say again, if anyone wants to join the conversation, and if you hear anything that is helping - feel free to come!
    - Chakkra: Definitely resonate with what Art Acrobat was saying. to an extent where, I had a convo with a brother — when you are introduced to a space full of people who are looking to pour into you, and looking to do the same and build in one with community (blackdave’s favorite word), we’re building a relationship that are filling us and reminding us of who we are and whose we are and it reminds you that, you are not who culture says you are fill in negative connotation. You are amazing, bold, excellent and move with fill in the blank. But it is necessary to — for the people who don’t know, that there are people who are vultures towards the cultures, it is important to know who the vultures look like. We can keep ourselves away from that energy. But if there are people who don’t know what the snake look like, you are babies to the web3. It can damage them. That’s not the energy we want to portray, but if we don’t recognize that there are different negative energies in positive spaces, then people will think too idealistically. There are people who don’t want to see progress. Without the people, there is no progress. In the state of struggle, and moving towards better tomorrow, we must recognize there is an enemy in our lives, and we will need to address them and we need to acknowledge and call that out. People get burned from web3 to web2, etc. You say “wow, this happened, I don’t want to work with this” due to one encounter. But if you didn’t even know if this type of person exists. I think it’s a sense of urgency when we see the negativity, “how do I move forward to Pat? How do I lean on these people?” because those people protect you from that negative energy.
        - How can I best show up for you as a technologist to support you in your journey as an artist?
    - Almond: let’s talk about code literacy and community.
    - Pat: I don’t like, and people who have worked with labels and getting paid in the music industry, if anybody has dealt with that at anytime, projects or placements takes forever. What I love about — what I will say, what I don’t want to see in web3 is tardiness. I thank God for developers and people — here’s where the tech is important. Where, we get our moneys right away! We get our money right out the gate. But I do want to see the artists in this space, to be timely and punctual. I haven’t seen that not happening, but more artists being consistent. When you see people say something and followthrough, it is good. Especially with blackdave rolling out stuff, and jameecornelia, and Devin Tracy.
    - James: What Art said in the beginning made me think about this. When we think of web2, it is not this mythical goliath. But none of these entities exist outside of us. So let’s reframe the question, and have us look at ourselves: what practices and attitudes from web2 do we want to get rid of from ourselves, as we venture into web3?
        - Art: not caring what other people think. It’s not my purpose — I want to bring in my purpose and keep out the doubt that would do otherwise.
        - Chakkra: unlearn the idea that every interaction has to have a quid pro quo attached to it. Shout out to James and Pat. My trait that I do not like is not asking for anything — I don’t want to come off sounding stupid asking a question that I coulda google’d myself. The whole thing of being burned for a bid or a mix — waiting for bread for some verses you did or whatever, I don’t personally for me, be doing much of anything for that, but based off of the interaction for folk artist-wise. It’s difficult to deal with the idea that everything will be blessed in web3 when you are still trying to protect burns in web2. Bring that web2 love and bridge the gap, because everything seems to be cashgrab sensitive. At least from my end of the perspective.
            - Pat: That’s something I have had to learn over the last couple of years. I’ve been leaning on my manager for help.
        - Tam: I came in to let you know that your Peloton monitor has arrived! I am the wife of the amazing Pat Junior. Great friends with James. I have not talked to Almond just yet, but def after! I resonated with Chakkra - on aspect of being fearful — to be honest, it sounds like I have a lot of people in this room that veer confident, and not be concerned with what others think, but I have a fear of the unknown when it comes to this because it is so new and Pat takes time to explain things to me, but I don’t understand or get it! It’s hard to get my brain around it, and that in itself gives me anxiety to go full force, and really wanting to do research — as Chakkra said, I don’t want to sound silly, but Pat told me that you don’t ask alot of question, but I don’t want to sound stupid. I pride myself on being knowledgeable on alot of things, so with this being so new and all of that, so it is a bit fearful, so I want to get that out of my way so I can put myself out there. I struggle saying this, but I’m a really good photographer. So to add to the conversation, I would like to put that down and pick up confidence and assurance that there’s space for me in this realm. I can’t remember who said it, but someone said “depend on the people that are there to help.”
            - Pat: in web2, there’s not a lot of that knowledge sharing. You need to be very people connected or whatever, and even my homie in the audience — you need to be in the industry if you will for a while, to happen. So I definitely appreciate what Tam said, and in web3, this is what this space is for! s/o to my wife. That’s something that we have in web3. Devin Tracy is an amazing singer and songwriter and super.
        - Devin Tracy: introduced himself to the crowd. Welcome, Devin!
            - I want to see more people supporting. I don’t want it to get lost like, you know how in the music industry, people get supportive, then they forget one other person — I want people to show appreciation. That’s what I want to see in the web3 space. A lot of things get lost in web2, but it’s still new but want to continue growth and grow and help with one another.
        - JPReynolds: I was going to respond to the question earlier asked: about what internally in ourselves what to leave behind. For me, I think this is a deep thing - such a large part of my experience has been in the web2 adjacent space. Letting go of doing anything that operates outside alignment. I’ve done things and made decisions and apply strategies that — I didn’t feel like it sat right, right away, because it was supposed to happen for artists at the time. Example: TikTok. It works for some artists, but may not be resonant with me. It hurt my spirit - and it kind of hurts and reaching out, and don’t want to operate in this for alignment. I got on the line with Chakkra — like, one of my takeaways is between expression — artist should express on inventory with what experiencing, and one of the things that I’ve been doing work to not get caught up in, after express or expressed, to care too much about impressions. The metric in web2 is impressions, like algorithms and retweets — so when we express and care too much about impressions, it can lead to depression. For me, that’s a big part of the web2 space that I want to let go of, and I feel like I turned a bit of a corner. It’s long sloping, but I’m turning it.
