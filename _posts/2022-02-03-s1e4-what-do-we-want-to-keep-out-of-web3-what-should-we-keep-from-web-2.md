### Ground Rules

One voice at a time - If you talk over people we will give you a warning if it happens repeatedly you will be moved to the audience

No Shilling zone - Don’t sell us but feel free to tell us your story

Keep it in the middle- We can attach issues and topics but attacking people won’t be tolerated

Step up step back - If your talking a lot please step back and leave space for other voices if you are being quiet please step up and talk if your on stage (please don’t sit on stage silently we need your voice)

Feel free to share the room if it’s valuable

Our content is for educational purposes and to offer perspective and it is not financial advice. Please do your own research and be kind!
