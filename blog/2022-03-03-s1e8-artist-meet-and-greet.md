### Notes

- @PsalmOne: shares story of the come up in music industry; [new Big Silky release](https://twitter.com/PsalmOne/status/1499531449669672966)
- @iampatjunior: music industry is rough, and thankful for web3 with the new technology and artists being able to collaborate and being able to make decent money where they can fund their artist career. Not a lot of people understand that a label is just a machine with connections and money by you. But you can be your own label to do. At some point, I'll be sharing how to do that as I do it myself and very proud of it. 1-2 things away from having the full team, but very possible. 
- @PsalmOne: There's nothing wrong with being a superstar or being super famous. A lot of people set the bar very high for themselves and being a working artist, making a living, is such a blessing. That's not setting the bar low. As artists, we understand what it takes to be an indie artist that is making a good living. It's very difficult. With wealth, there's people who want to make billions and they have to make so many decisions in order to be there. Millionaires have to make a lot of decisions but is a lot more tangible for a lot of people and what you're willing to do. The team needs to be down for the artist. Hard work beats talent, but you'll see artists go way further because they're not arrogant of where they are and have a clear idea of where they can go and execute. Execution is the biggest thing.
- Pat: Very recently, February 9 or 10, I dropped my genesis NFT and there is a [PartyBid active for it](https://www.partybid.app/party/0xBb873639Ffbd8ED10b3Ec31F8013dbfA50Ce6610)! It's something I'm proud of and it's called Put It On. I like getting together and breaking bread with the people. Brought friends along with me for new projects and have visuals thinking about minting as well that go along with that project. James and I have been talking and once we get the Genesis NFT going -- Almond heard one of the things I have up my sleeve. I'm excited to bring this to web3 because I'm definitely a creative mind when it comes to rolling out stuff and creating worlds. That's one of the things that's got me hype about web3. I have a cool project that I'm doing with the artist that digitally painted the artwork, Cryptic Donuts, and we're working on that and super excited about that. I don't know if you came to the drop party room, but we were talking and shared how when we were younger, she was always the kid sister that I put out the room while we played video games. But now years later we're working on music shit and art shit! Something poetic about it.
- kells: I'm new to the web3 space. I'm a born self-promoter. I'm getting all this information from you all. I want to thank everyone in the room for that. Imagine if Gucci grew up in the suburbs and was depressed. That's what I'm doing!
- visionnaire: There's an earlier convo that inspired me to come up. There's a growing divide between artists and creators. With the destruction of the middle class, especially in the United States, there's a destruction of that bridge that people transfer from "lower class" to social and economic mobility to the upper class. As the bridge burns, there's no room for people to exist in the middle. Web3 provides tools for artists to thrive. Thriving isn't like selling a million records or Drake level on Spotify, but a middle class of artists if that could exist. What does it look like for people to do 50K or 60K a year and they don't have to work for a company, but for themselves? That's really what intrigued me when learned it originally -- there's a way for people to build sustainable careers that don't have to amount to winning a grammy or win a BET award. There's a way for people to do it and -- a community that understands and responds accordingly, that's a real community and that's what I feel is something important to note. When I have these convos, I try to say this. We're in the process of doing this as artists, and we're the front end developers of web3 technology and that's really cool because it gives us the opportunity to build interfaces to allow people to create a whole new economy with us. That's the best way to frame it with us on stage and in audience, or to explain this for people who are here in this space or new in this space, and that's my purpose as a recording artist. I'm done speaking. <3
- Pat: Give us a little something! 
- visionnaire: V for short. I'm a recording artist, producer, and creative director. It is my way of contributing to the world. My Genesis which will be shooting later this year is this song off of my second album, song called Yams, song about body positivity, and focus for that song is a runway song and a theme song for Black women. I'm doing a crowdfund on Mirror called Project Yams Grow Fund. I'm growing a garden, that's the name of the community, and the first crop I'm growing is the music video for Yams. What I'm doing with the crowdfund -- if you buy the token, and you're not a black woman, you nominate a black woman to co-produce with it. I'm instituting an architecture for all to participate while having the appropriate boundaries. Check out my tweets and retweets and the crowdfund - just take a read. -> https://twitter.com/vsnaire
- IAMNICOLECASH.ETH | I wanted to speak on earlier -- if you don't know, it's just, that was just a lot for me. Not even to try to get people to sympahtize for me just speaking on what visionnaire was saying, but supporting people in the community, and not making people feel like they are not doing themselves, and some people only got themselves. There's only one person pushing their stuff and -- I just got involved with web3. Outside web3, I pushed my music so hard and it got as far as it has by going as far as it did. To be in a community where it's so this and that -- then you come to me, nicely, come down because people in the community feel like you're doing too much.
  - Pat:  This is an opportunity for us to get to know who you are. We want to know -- this is your platform -- we want to hear what you're working on. Let's focus on that.
  - Nicole: I will say what needs to be said and want to speak to visionnaire with what he's saying, and I want you to know that. I am a singer, songwriter, and rapper and I love how hard I'm pushing for myself. I hope that you guys heard what I said and hear what I'm saying as a human being working hard to push myself where I am and I have a lot of people looking at me and people looking down upon me. It is only me -- my music is on all streaming platforms, and DM me if you want to collaborate with me. Checkout my bio @ITISNICOLECASH -- I have a project in web3 called READ MY MIND -- I drove all the way from Alabama to North Carolina to record it. READ MY MIND was one of the songs that I recorded and shot the video and it was a whole lot. I can probably talk about this all day because the story is crazy but I want to give you the short version. 40 edits, a lot of the stuff we did in the video and took (request to pin). This is personal for me and it's real for me. Blood sweat and tears for this shit for me.
  - Kells: Your shit go crazy. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
  - Pat: I want to emphasize that everyone should share what you resonate with - everyone is not going to like your stuff. It is important that we acknowledge stuff that's dope, fire, and if we rock with it, we share it. But, focus on the people that are supporting you, supporting them, and if they are putting out Top Tier Mid, let them know, and we appreciate you sharing for sure.
  - Devin: I want to share some encouragement - when you said Pat, connecting -- I understand and feel you, and saw what was going on. Nicole you are very talented but also be consistent and that's the word -- I want to focus on myself and focus on my innerbeing and well being. I'm messing up my words -- but I would say, be consistent and ignore the bullshit and be a light to everyone. Everyone in the community will start to come to you.
  - Nicole: I appreciate those kind words and do what I've been doing. That's all I can do. I'll still speak on things because a lot of people
- Jazii: I dove straight head first in and was in Twitter Spaces and listening at first, but by the second week I started introducing. For Nicole: I'm very new in this space as well, and wanted to encourage you. Just know I'm preaching to myself halfway, but when you feel unseen, I want to encourage you to keep on going and just try to lead with love and show who you really are. People will slowly find you. I don't just share music but I talk about my kids and thingsd I love and it's really a good thing and not a robot that's all music-music-music. There are people who feel what you're saying and there's one of these people that search for that familiar face and you're going to find that person and look directly in each others eyes and it will only be up from there. Just wanted to let you know that you're not the only one going through that. You have amazing work and you're worth that amount of money for people to spend. Your time is going to come. Keep your head down and do what you know how to do best. Just wanted to send that to you. I'm Jazii and come connect!
