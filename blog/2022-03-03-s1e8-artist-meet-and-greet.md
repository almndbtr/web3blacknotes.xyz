### Notes

- @PsalmOne: shares story of the come up in music industry; [new Big Silky release](https://twitter.com/PsalmOne/status/1499531449669672966)
- @iampatjunior: music industry is rough, and thankful for web3 with the new technology and artists being able to collaborate and being able to make decent money where they can fund their artist career. Not a lot of people understand that a label is just a machine with connections and money by you. But you can be your own label to do. At some point, I'll be sharing how to do that as I do it myself and very proud of it. 1-2 things away from having the full team, but very possible. 
- @PsalmOne: There's nothing wrong with being a superstar or being super famous. A lot of people set the bar very high for themselves and being a working artist, making a living, is such a blessing. That's not setting the bar low. As artists, we understand what it takes to be an indie artist that is making a good living. It's very difficult. With wealth, there's people who want to make billions and they have to make so many decisions in order to be there. Millionaires have to make a lot of decisions but is a lot more tangible for a lot of people and what you're willing to do. The team needs to be down for the artist. Hard work beats talent, but you'll see artists go way further because they're not arrogant of where they are and have a clear idea of where they can go and execute. Execution is the biggest thing.
- Pat: Very recently, February 9 or 10, I dropped my genesis NFT and there is a [PartyBid active for it](https://www.partybid.app/party/0xBb873639Ffbd8ED10b3Ec31F8013dbfA50Ce6610)! It's something I'm proud of and it's called Put It On. I like getting together and breaking bread with the people. Brought friends along with me for new projects and have visuals thinking about minting as well that go along with that project. James and I have been talking and once we get the Genesis NFT going -- Almond heard one of the things I have up my sleeve. I'm excited to bring this to web3 because I'm definitely a creative mind when it comes to rolling out stuff and creating worlds. That's one of the things that's got me hype about web3. I have a cool project that I'm doing with the artist that digitally painted the artwork, Cryptic Donuts, and we're working on that and super excited about that. I don't know if you came to the drop party room, but we were talking and shared how when we were younger, she was always the kid sister that I put out the room while we played video games. But now years later we're working on music shit and art shit! Something poetic about it.
