### What kind of collector are you?

- Kizzie: "I'm an artist. When I peek behind the crypto curtain, I knew I wanted to really collect stuff that is visually -- I started to collect things on other blockchains like TEZ, with lower gas and really recommend it for people who don't want to pay all of these gas fees, or spend a ton of money, or not have a ton of money right now. 1 TEZ is about 4USD, so you can buy stuff on Object.com, and get some cool art and support artists all over the marketplace. I'm an Object.com AVID collector, so I can find something really dope. There's a lot of music NFTs making their way on there, as well as my own. I'm mostly TEZ collector, and I want to get my ETH up and bid on people's stuff on ZORA or OpenSea. My goal as a collector is to support the artists, first and foremost, and I put my ETH back into the art and the artist.
- Pat: "I've always wanted to look at other blockchains. How is navigating the TEZ blockchain? Is it easier/harder? James wanted to find out more about it, but let us know like how it is."
- Kizzie: "I started when it was previous version to where it is Object.com marketplace. I will try to find other things to pin, and James can holler at me offline. Some people use OpenSea and MetaMask, but Object.com -- my wallet is kukai. That's what I use -- Objekt.com -- it is not as user-friendly as opensea, but it's not too bad. You can see the latest mints, the top sales, and what people are doing. There's thousands of new art that is coming on there and stuff to look at. You just browse, it's pretty easy if you want to buy or bid. Let me know if you want more of a tour through!"
- Pat: I want to look at Solana as well. Their logo is very appealing to me.
- Almond: I buy things that spark joy (s/o to Marie Kondo). I look at myself as a Patronage+ person.
- Pat: If you're enjoying the convo, share it on the timeline!
  - Appreciate everyone hopping in.
  - I want to talk about the collector I want to be, when I make sales. I'm adopting, or learning, what it is to be a creative socialist. I like to share my platform with other people. As I grow, in wealth, I love giving. Not just money, but my time. And my efforts to people. To help lift them up to -- there's enough room for everyone to eat. I never understood the concept in the music industry to hide or gatekeep information. I'm not asking folks to share everything in the world -- the music industry is financially robust and big. There's enough for everyone to eat. It is the same as web3, and I definitely want to, when I collect pieces, I want to be supporting black women in this space. I'm raised by black women and married to a black woman. I want to support them in the space. I want to own a FAITH piece, a KIZZIE piece, an IMAN, there's just -- a plethora of dope black women in the space, and dope art in general. As far as music is concerned, I want to own those pieces. If Kizzie or Jasmine wins a Grammy one day and their value goes super high down the road, I might have to -- I don't know.
    - Kizzie: I am working on a book. If that becomes a best seller, and I have an NFT, that could be worth something. 
  - Pat: James: it's called Invisible Friends? So for this project, we've been eyeing them and we've been talking about them, and there's some PFP projects to get into flipping, but as far as art is concerned -- as far as like, there's a FAITH piece or illustrators, I want to buy one of my sister's pieces to show love and support. I want to hold some stuff and hold them long-term. I want to hold them, and collect art in the web3 space, especially Black art. I want to see more Black art, illustrators, and I want to be those Black Artists that can support Black Artists.
  - James: Kizzie -- isn't the book, can we preorder it right now?
    - Kizzie: my homie did that and I will pin that. 
  - James: I will hold my Invisible Friend.
    - James: I will say that I have collected what has been aesthetically pleasing to me. I believe in what the project is doing, and as I'm collecting, I want to support Black artists, Black women, and hold some dope art. But I guess, I make music NFTs but I struggle with is -- how do I play them? In the showcase of the Rainbow wallet, I can play it. Does that work?
- Jasmin: Pat is genuine online and offline. Blessed to cross paths. I jumped up here -- Kizzie, what you said about what an artist is doing offline, I believe that brings additional value to these collective NFTs. When your book is released -- for any artist or wanting to support, what they do offline, Pat showed me something that was so amazing and held it at a Contemporary Art museum. Our art forms to be taken seriously -- to have a story to tell, and be inducted in any way, in a museum is a huge accomplishment. That is no small feat and to continue to do things on that caliber, it takes a lot of work and tears and questioning -- any artist that does that, you have to know they have gone through so much. To make stuff here and on the outside, that is so amazing and loved what you said Kizzie.
  - Kizzie: Thanks! I appreciate that. Also, it rings true for an artist that wants to revalue themselves, refinance you know what I mean? I remember that in web2, I had stuff for free and had a paywall, but in web3, I've seen artists re-list things for a higher price and updates the value. It's cool when it happens both way. I'm not a big flipper, but one of the pieces I bought the other day -- I bought for 1.5 TEZ -- but now I saw it today it is 13 TEZ. So, I was like, wait a minute? How did that happen? The artist might have been like, this is worth more, and this is my first attempt at a flip, and if the big comes through, and you make however much -- I have ETH in the stash, but I can't spend it all on that because I need it to mint some more. The gas fees are prohibitive at times, and artists need to pivot, and heard evaluations on Polygon and Solana, and requires exploring. For a creator and a collector, it's a natural sort of thing. 
  - Pat: What kind of collectors I want -- 
  - Dom: I will start collecting, but when hardware starts catching up so I can have a frame and display NFTs and music at my house.
    - Almond: check out Infinite Objects!

### What kind of collectors do you want?

- Kizzie: if someone wants to buy my NFT, one of them got sold for 0.55 ETH which was around the time, $1500.00 -- there's so much more utility that you get with that purchase. You get private Zoom with me, merch pack, but if you get it on TEZOS, you get my full attention, and I might send you a shirt, but it is partial utility. I like the idea of different tiers. They're just like, they'll pick up 2 of yours, but I know people that got both and they're used to doing that, and it's just cheaper. I like to appeal to people -- it's like a vinyl collection. I don't think necessarily that there's going to be music collectors now that have this huge music collection, but it's going to be raw and super dope, because it's heavily curated. For me, I want music snobs and I want my fans that already exist in [...]. If I am successful more than where I am today, I want to see my stuff getting flipped on at secondary. It shows value in your art and in this moment in time right now, and whether you think artists or overvalued or undervalued, but the value is being placed. I want to go back to something Pat said -- we need to operate with scarcity mindset, if someone sells for 5 ETH, and it doesn't get bid on right away, and it's crazy. There's definitely different kinds of collectors out there, and I want there to be people to get there early. My project is part of a bigger project, and NFTs are part of the bigger story. 
- James: I like the idea of tiers with different utility. When you mentioned onboarding people from web2, to hear that and you do it and it works, I wonder: were you hearing that noise as you came into space, and what made you reach out and how difficult was that transition to support you on the web3 side?
  - Kizzie: some people were already in web3, but the one person I onboarded -- he had asked me a month or so before I dropped an NFT, if I dropped one yet. We had a convo about it, and I'd let him know when I dropped it -- but it was dropped, I hit him up and say, I want to let you know that I dropped it -- we caught up, and I want to bid on that. But, I can't do it today, so it took a few extra days, but he came through and he's a busy dude, that's my homie. We got it done, and he already had a Coinbase, and a Metamask, so for that -- he was already like, over the hump of like, getting the Coinbase verification and all that. It wasn't a crazy onboarding, and he forgot the process but it was kind of like, really dope that I was able to remember -- he's not really online. But he wouldn't know it if I didn't tell him. Some people joke about it as a scam, but I'm not really worried about being scammed because I'm an artist that's creating value. I'm here to use the technology and be here to create. There's many parallels from you know, fine artists where the work in the gallery, and where are you going to find the collateral?
- Dom Deshawn: this is a really good topic. I'm in an interesting space -- a few of the people on the stage, only have 1 NFT or maybe 2 actually created. So the amount of collectors that we have isn't a long list, so right now it's that phase -- but there are collectors who really like the artists and want to support in that type of way. I really want to be able to have and have those superfans, like people who will like, download lyrics or really tap in and dive into my music and support not just my project, but anything I go for. The cool thing about web3 is that you have the opportunity to contact these people. I want to build that relationship with, and people who believe in me. And, as I think about it, when years ago -- when J COLE did the Forest Hill drive release and going to people's cribs like that, having the opportunity to do that, there might be a case where I fly you out and listen to a new album of mine. And I might just do a show in your city and you do free tickets -- there's a connection with somebody, and having that with the collector. I'd rather it be somebody who pays attention to my work and believes in my work, instead of flippers. I want to build the personal connection with somebody. I feel like I want to build a connection with them.
- Pat: Again, it's always really cool how, I have, like these fire conversations before our spaces and they tie into what we're talking about in the space. Just like, I don't think it is coincidence. Me and Jasmine were talking about creating where we are in life, and our music is fresh and current, to where we are. So, it makes it very personable. I rock with alot of what you were saying.
- END: Almond stopped taking notes at 5:28PM PST.
